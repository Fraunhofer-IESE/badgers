# About

The development of [badgers](https://github.com/Fraunhofer-IESE/badgers) was initially driven by Julien Siebert at the Data Science Department of the Fraunhofer Institute for Experimental Software Engineering ([IESE](https://www.iese.fraunhofer.de/)) in Kaiserslautern, Germany.

The original idea came during internal discussions with Patricia Kelbert, Adam Trendowicz, and Michael Kl√§s.

A big thanks to Daniel Seifert for taking the time to investigate and automate all the many things that make our lives as package contributors easier.
